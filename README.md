following.

UWI	recruitment	
UWI	stores	information	about programmes	that	it	offers,	it	would	like	to	create	a	
progressive	web	application	that	can	run	on	mobile	devices	that	will	allow	users	to	access	
information	that	they	have	collected	from	these	programmes.	
The	system	will	keep	track	of	which	students	visit	and	view	information	provided,	to	be	able	
to	give	appropriate	recommendations	for	possible	programmes	based	on	their	interest.
